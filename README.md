<summary><strong>üìà Key Insights & Recommendations</strong></summary>

- **Technology** was the highest-selling product category.  
- **Express Air** was the most expensive shipping method; however, many low-priority orders used it unnecessarily.  
- **Emily Phan** was the most valuable and profitable customer (Tech-focused).  
- **Dennis Kane** had the highest small business sales.  
- **Adam Hart** placed the most corporate orders (18 total).  
- **Over 800 orders** had mismatched shipping vs priority, costing KMS ‚Ç¶25,000+.  
- Most returns came from **Consumer** and **Small Business** segments.

üîé **Suggestions:**
