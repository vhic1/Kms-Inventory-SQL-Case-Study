---Question 6? Who are the most valuable customers, and what product or services do they typically purchase?

-- Step 1: Get total sales by customer and category
WITH CustomerCategorySales AS (
SELECT Customer_Name,Product_Category,
SUM(Sales) AS Category_Sales
FROM Case_Study
GROUP BY Customer_Name, Product_Category),
-- Step 2: Rank each category per customer (most sales first)
RankedCategories AS (
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
PARTITION BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Category_Sales DESC) AS rn
FROM CustomerCategorySales),
-- Step 3: Get total sales per customer (for top 5)
CustomerTotals AS (
SELECT Customer_Name, SUM(Category_Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM CustomerCategorySales
GROUP BY Customer_Name),
-- Step 4: Top 5 customers by total sales
Top5Customers AS (
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM CustomerTotals
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC)
-- Step 5: Join to get each top customer's top product category
SELECT 
rc.Customer_Name,
rc.Product_Category AS Top_Product_Category,
rc.Category_Sales,
t5.Total_Sales
FROM RankedCategories rc
JOIN Top5Customers t5 ON rc.Customer_Name = t5.Customer_Name
WHERE rc.rn = 1
ORDER BY t5.Total_Sales DESC;
